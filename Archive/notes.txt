Calculate score:
-When someone votes on a photo, make a new entry to the "votes" table
-Check that there isn't already a result in this table before letting them vote again
-Every hour, update the leaderboards with the top 10 users (and display the current user's position on the ranking when they're logged in)

(These might require ajax as well as PHP and MySQL)
Sign up:
-Get username from text box 
-Check that username is valid (if a MySQL error would be thrown by just trying to submit it, check that the count of users with that username is 0)
-If so, post it to the table with a unique ID (or say the problem otherwise)

Log in:
-Check that username and password match the database (VERY VERY FAR FROM SECURE, but it'll be a lot faster to implement it this way and this way of logging in is mostly just for debugging), and if they do return the corresponding userid
-Store a cookie called "userid" with the value of the matching userid
